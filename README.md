# Object Detection and Projectile Visualization

This project is an object detection system that identifies objects through a live webcam feed and visualizes their trajectories. The project offers two distinct visualization methods to create dynamic and aesthetic canvases based on object classifications.

## Features

- **Live Webcam Feed:** Real-time object detection using a 4K web camera.
- **Object Tracking:** Tracks objects in motion and visualizes their projectiles.
- **Two Visualization Modes:**
  1. **Overlay Mode:** Displays projectiles on top of the live camera feed.
  2. **Canvas Mode:** Projects trajectories on a plain black background.
- **Aesthetic Coloring:** Objects are assigned colors based on their class to create visually appealing outputs.
